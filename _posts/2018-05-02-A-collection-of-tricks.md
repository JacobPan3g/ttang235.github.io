1. Closing a chrome tab: You can **click** on the middle key (scroll wheel) of the mouse to close a chrome browser tab when your cursor is above the 
tab. So no need to find the small cross and left click on it to close the tab. (Sure, shortcut `ctrl+w` works too.) 
2. Scroll reverser for mac: https://pilotmoon.com/scrollreverser/
3. popCalendar (in app store) on mac: making it easy to see the date for today on menu bar, and the whole month/year.
